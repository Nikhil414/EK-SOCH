                <p class="text-xl"><strong>Mumbai:</strong> Real estate is often associated with property prices, investment returns, and infrastructure development. However, in a recent episode of the <strong>Ek Soch Podcast</strong>, real estate professional <strong>Kaushall Prakash</strong> highlighted the deeper responsibilities that come with every property transaction.</p>
                <p class="text-xl">Speaking on the show, Kaushall Prakash said that buying a home is not merely a financial decision, but a life-changing milestone that affects families for generations.</p>
                <br>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="text-2xl md:text-2xl text-off-white font-serif leading-tight  m-0!">“Every deal carries someone’s dreams and future,” he said during the conversation. “It is a responsibility that goes far beyond paperwork.”</p>

                    <p class="text-xl">During the episode, Prakash discussed how home ownership plays a crucial role in shaping social and financial stability in India. For many families, purchasing a home represents years of savings and long-term planning. According to him, real estate decisions influence children's education, lifestyle choices, and long-term security.</p>
                    <p class="text-xl">He shared examples of families who struggled for years before securing their own homes, emphasising the emotional significance of such moments.</p>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-off-white font-serif  m-0!">"Behind every file is a family waiting for certainty," he noted.</p>

                    <p class="text-xl">A major theme of the discussion was trust between buyers and real estate professionals. Home buyers often invest their lifetime savings into a single property, expecting transparency and legal clarity. Prakash stressed that this trust places a moral obligation on developers and agents.</p>

                    <p class="text-xl">Prakash explained that these factors directly affect customer experience and project delivery.

                    <p class="text-xl">According to Kaushall Prakash, success in real estate is driven more by mindset than short-term profits. He identified key values such as empathy, discipline, and customer-centric thinking as essential for professionals in the sector.</p>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-off-white font-serif  m-0!">"Success is not measured by commissions alone, but by how many lives you positively impact," he remarked.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="text-xl">This approach, he believes, will play a critical role in strengthening trust in the industry.</p>

            <h2>1. Niche Down to Blow Up</h2>
            <p>Don't start a podcast for "everyone." Start it for someone. The more specific your audience, the deeper the connection.</p>

            <h2>2. Audio Quality is Non-Negotiable</h2>
            <p>People will forgive bad video, but they will not forgive bad audio. Invest in a decent dynamic microphone and learn basic EQ.</p>
